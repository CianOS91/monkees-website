User Centric Project - Monkees Website

The guidelines set for me were as follows-
1. Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
2. The band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.00004079
3. I was given the photos of the band member, a video clip, audio clips.
4. They are in the process of creating a social media presence and would like to add links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.
